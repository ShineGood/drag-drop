A simple and interactive web-based drag and drop sorting game where players sort fruits and vegetables into their correct categories before time runs out. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES Modules).

---

## Features

- Asynchronously loads item data from a `data.json` file.
- Displays a randomized list of draggable items.
- Includes two drop zones: one for **fruits** and one for **vegetables**.

## JSON Structure

The data.json file includes two arrays: fruits and vegetables. Each item has:

  "name": "Apple",
  "category": "fruit",
  "image": "images/baobab.png"
}

Validated using jsonlint.com.

## Installation & Usage

### Option 1: Local Server (Recommended for Development)

1. Install Node.js if not already installed.
2. Create a simple server.js file:
3. Run a local server (e.g., using `npm` and `express`, or `live-server`):
   ```bash
   npm install express
   node server.js
   Or use any static server to serve the public folder.
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the respective port).

### Option 2: Static Hosting (For Final Deployment)

1. Upload all files (including data.json) to a static hosting service:
  - GitHub Pages
  - Netlify
  - Vercel
2. Make sure the JSON file is in the root or accessible folder.

3. Update the fetch path in your code if necessary (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/data.json).

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, animations)
- JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
- Node.js & Express (for local server)

## How It Works

1. On page load, the app fetches data.json and dynamically displays all items.
2. Drag items from the container into the correct "Fruits" or "Vegetables" drop zones.
3. Correct drops increase your score and play a success sound.
4. Incorrect drops decrease your lives and play an error sound.
5. You have 3 lives and 60 seconds to sort all items correctly.
6. Use the Pause button to pause/resume the timer.
7. Use Reset to start a new game.
